//         <p className="abtMeP">Hello! My name is Jordan Mullen and thank you for checking my site out! I am a Full Stack Web Developer who can make all your dreams come true! Let’s start from the beginning. In 1995 I was born a twin; actually, let’s fast forward a bit. I grew up (still a twin) and found a passion for creating and learning. I picked up photography, a couple different instruments, chemistry, dance, and quite a few sports; it was great and beautiful, but I wanted to be challenged. I would delve into any new tech I found and I would see how and why it worked. From printers to computers, and eventually robots, I would learn from anything I could that used a power source. That mindset taught me how to be an avid learner and a skilled problem solver. I wanted to be able to solve my own technical problems efficiently and effectively. But how can I do this? I’ve got it! I thought, “After all these years I’ve always had a passion for technology. Coding would fulfill all of my fantasies.” After a few online courses I was hooked, and from there? History.</p>

//         <p className="abtMeP">Now that you know a little more about what makes me, me; I want to tell you about how I work. I am a very efficient and precise worker. If I stop what I am doing, I am able to start back up promptly. I am an avid learner, that can pick up any skill rapidly and effectively. That is why I knew web development would be perfect for me. Technologies are always changing and continuously require the expansion of what we know. The Google Fu is real. I am a hardcore team player. I love working in effective, dynamic, and self-sustaining teams. Coming together and creating something with people who love what they do is inimitable. In short, I am a team player who works hard, and can deliver with efficacy.</p>
