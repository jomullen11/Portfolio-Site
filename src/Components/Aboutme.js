        <hr/>
        <p className="abtMeP">Hello! My name is Jordan Mullen and thank you for checking out my site! I am a Full Stack Web Developer with an emphasis in JavaScript and ReactJS. I grew up loving to learn and create. Growing up I had a passion for photography, the great outdoors, and technology. I would delve into any new tech I found and I would see how and why it worked. From printers to computers, and eventually robots, I would learn from anything I could that used a power source. That mindset taught me how to be an avid learner and a skilled problem solver. I wanted to be able to create beautiful applications that are versatile, and easy to use. I knew that being a Full Stack Web Developer would be the path for me. After a few online courses I was hooked! From there? History.</p>
        <br />
        <p className="abtMeP">Now that you know a little more about what makes me, me; I want to tell you about how I work. I am a very productive and precise worker. If I stop what I am doing, I am able to start back up promptly. I am an avid learner, that can learn new skills quickly and efficiently. That is why I knew web development would be perfect for me. Technologies are always changing and continuously require the expansion of what we know. The Google Fu is real. I am a hardcore team player. I love working in effective, dynamic, and self-sustaining teams. Coming together and creating something with people who love what they do is inimitable. In short, I am a team player who works hard, and can deliver with efficacy.</p>
